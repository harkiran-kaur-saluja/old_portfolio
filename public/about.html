            <br>
            <p>Hello there! I’m Harkiran (she/her, pronounced harr-KI-run). I grew up in Southern California and later moved to Seattle to pursue my passion for technology. In June of 2021, I graduated from the University of Washington with a <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics">Bachelor of Science in Informatics</a>: Human-Computer Interaction and a minor in Gender, Woman, & Sexuality Studies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Master of Human-Computer Interaction</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, where I conduct research as part of the <a href="https://www.thecoalalab.com/#people">CoALA Lab</a> and overall dive deeper into HCI so that I can become the best practitioner I can be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the future, my aim through research is to use co-design to improve children's education inside and outside of the classroom. Feel free to check out my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FyUvGMgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lately, I’ve been spending my free time watching Schitt’s Creek!</p>
